An overall hike planner. Lighterpack, MyFitnessPal, resupply planner, etc!

All dev is done on the PCT trail via my phone.

## Food Planner

The goal of food planner is to be able to input section details (miles, elevation, cal/day, days) in order to generate the total calories required. From there, users can go to the store, scan barcodes (uses OpenFoodFacts for API data), or manually enter data, to view core stats (protein to carb macro ratio, weight per cal), and they can scan until calories and macros reach perfection.
