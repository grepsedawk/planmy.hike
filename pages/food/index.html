<h1>allycat.ðŸ’•'s Food Planner</h1>
<p>
  The goal of food planner is to be able to input section details (miles,
  elevation, cal/day, days) in order to generate the total calories required.
  From there, users can go to the store, scan barcodes (uses OpenFoodFacts for
  API data), or manually enter data, to view core stats (protein to carb macro
  ratio, weight per cal), and they can scan until calories and macros reach
  perfection.
